<h1> Deck of Cards </h1>

<h2> Summary </h2>

This is a project where we generate cards and decks utilizing both enum and IEnumerable to both create a deck of cards.  
I utilize the enums in my class for each card, allowing Cards creation to only be values of Ace-King and of Heart, Club, 
Diamonds, and Spades.  As is A-typical for a deck of cards.  The goal to to create things like the deck 
can be used for any card game.  Like uno for example.  All is needed is to create a new card class for uno, and 
we should still be able to utilize the class Deck.
